# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The aim of this project was to demostrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

This repository contains the following files:

* run_analysis.R
* CodeBook.md
* README.md
 
The first file contains the required scripts for obtaining the tidy dataset; the second one describes the contents, structure, and layout of the data; and the third document contains the information you are reading.
